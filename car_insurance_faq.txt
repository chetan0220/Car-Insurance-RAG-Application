# Car Insurance FAQ Document

Car insurance is a contract that protects you against financial loss in the event of an accident or theft. There are several types of car insurance, such as liability, collision, comprehensive, personal injury protection, and uninsured motorist coverage.

For a sedan, liability insurance is mandatory, while comprehensive and collision coverage are recommended for better protection. Commercial vehicles require commercial auto insurance, which covers business-related risks and higher liability limits.

Car insurance is mandatory in most regions to legally drive a vehicle. To buy car insurance, you typically need your driver’s license, vehicle registration, and proof of address. Premiums are calculated based on factors like vehicle type, driver’s age, driving history, location, and coverage type.

Insurance can be transferred to another vehicle by notifying your insurer and updating your policy details. Common exclusions include intentional damage, driving under the influence, and using the vehicle for illegal activities. To file a claim, contact your insurer, provide necessary documents, fill out a claim form, and follow the insurer’s process for assessment and settlement.

Add-on covers such as zero depreciation, roadside assistance, and engine protection can be purchased to enhance your car insurance policy. These add-ons provide extra protection and peace of mind in specific situations.

No Claim Bonus (NCB) is a discount offered by insurers for every claim-free year. It can significantly reduce your premium and is transferable if you switch insurers or buy a new vehicle.

The renewal process for car insurance is simple and can often be completed online. If your policy lapses, you may lose benefits like NCB and may need to get your vehicle inspected before renewal.

Digital insurance allows you to buy, renew, and manage your car insurance policy online. It offers convenience, quick policy issuance, and easy access to policy documents.

Third-party insurance covers damages to other people or property, while comprehensive insurance covers both third-party liabilities and damages to your own vehicle. Comprehensive insurance is recommended for broader protection.

After an accident, ensure everyone’s safety, inform the police if required, and contact your insurer as soon as possible. Provide all necessary documents and cooperate with the surveyor for a smooth claim process.

Common reasons for claim rejection include incomplete documentation, policy lapses, driving under the influence, and providing false information. Always read your policy terms and maintain accurate records to avoid claim issues.
